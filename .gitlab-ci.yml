# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages
#
#stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
#  - build
#  - test
#  - deploy
#
#build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
#  stage: build
#  script:
#    - echo "Compiling the code..."
#    - echo "Compile complete.
#
#unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
#  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
#  script:
#    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
#    - sleep 60
#    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"
#
#lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
#  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
#  script:
#    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
#    - sleep 10
#    - echo "No lint issues found."
#
#deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
#  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
#  script:
#    - echo "Deploying application..."
#    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
